Drupalurk
---------

Drupalurk is a Chrome extension I wrote for a presentation to show how
content from Drupal can be used in non-Drupal contexts.

The extension pulls #drupal tweets live and allows browsing of recent
Drupal news. It also has a simple chat that allows users of the extension
to chat if the universe puts them in the channel at the same time.

The tweet pulling is done via the Twitter Javascript API and the Drupal news
feed is generated in JSON by a Drupal site (using the Views Datasource
views_json module). The chat is driven by node.js (and crudely embedded
using an iframe) and is a slightly modified version of Ryan Dahl's Node
Chat (http://github.com/ry/node_chat).

Google-hosted JQuery is used for the Javascriptery.
